- Goal: observe evolution of mutational switches
    - Sub-goals:
           What underlying strucutre is for mutational switches. @swom
           what are the assumptions necessary for mutational switches. @deadparrot69
           Elegantly show this principle with the simplest model.
 - Requirements: 
   - Network representing G-P, fixed/genetic input(1), hidden layer, output(1).
   - Fluctuating environment between two states --> see if time to adaptation goes down+mutational distance is minimized (i.e. mutation swtich observed)
